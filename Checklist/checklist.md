## JavaScript

1. Never use global variables
2. Avoid tight coupling
  1. How: If you change one thing (a global variable name), it should not break another (a function)!
3. Avoid name collisions
  1. How: You should write as few global variables as possible. Write your variables inside of the functions that need them, keeping them as close to where they are needed as possible.
