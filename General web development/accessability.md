## Description

Improve user experience for everyone by adressing accessability


## Form

1. Don't use low contrast labels
  why: Hard to read
2. Don't have form labels on the left, and form field on the right
  why: Hard to associate between them
3. Make users be able to click labels instead of checkboxes
  why: Makes it easier for them to click it

## POUR

Is your site:

1. Perceivable (content)
2. Operable (navigation)
3. Understandable (content and interface)
4. Robust (consumable by a wide variety of user agents?)


## WCAG
