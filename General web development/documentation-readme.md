Why write documentation? Think about an old project. Do you remember everything you were thinking at that time? Wouldnt it be helpful to have a reference you could look at?

1. Always start with a title and a discription

2. Ask yourself
  a. What steps need to be taken?
  b. What should the user already have installed or configured?
  c. What might they have a hard time understanding right away?

3. Add a licencing section

4. Add a contribution section if you want people to contribute on your project

5. Add known bugs

6. Add FAQ

7. Add Table of contents
